Estimate Apéry's constant, a constant used in quantum electrodynamics and the value of zeta(3).
It is approximately equal to 1.20205 69031.
You can estimate Apéry's constant by drawing three random numbers 100 times. Keep track of how many times
the numbers are coprime (GCD == 1) Apéry's constant is roughly (# trials) / (# coprime)
